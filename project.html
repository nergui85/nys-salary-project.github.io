<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>New York City (NYC) is recognized as having the largest regional
economy in the United States (5). However, cities around the country
suffered economic losses during the COVID-19 pandemic and the prospects
of a recession are stirring fears of an uncertain economy. City managers
are more cautious about fiscal spending compared to previous years in
response to COVID-19. Our motivation is to use a dataset on NYC OpenData
focused on the base salaries of municipal employees in New York State to
better understand how the budget of several New York State counties are
allocated toward salaries for the year 2022, two years after the
COVID-19 pandemic began. We are interested in comprehending the mean
base salaries of municipal employees for each county in New York State
in 2022. As a result, we will perform statistical analysis through an
ANOVA to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean base
salary across all counties of New York State. If there is a significant
difference, we would also like to know which counties exhibit a
significant difference in the mean base salary of their municipal
employees. We would also like to explore additional factors, such as the
total other pay, overtime pay, the top job titles in certain counties,
and the number of job titles by each county, within the data to see if
they can explain the phenomenon that is observed with the base salaries
of municipal employees.</p>

<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>In an article written by Kery Murakami, she explains the financial
resources that the government allocated to cities. In 2022, the cities
in the United States have been recovering from the negative impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic. With inflation on the rise, city governments have
been hesitant about spending. Farhad Kaab Omeyr, a Program Director for
Research and Data at NLC’s Center for City Solutions, explained that:
“Governments are being super cautious and fiscally conservative when it
comes to budgeting for the near future and for fiscal year 2022 and
2023”(1). The U.S government has assisted these cities by “providing
$45.6 billion in direct federal pandemic aid for cities, along with
another $19.5 billion for smaller-sized local governments”(1). These
financial resources given by the government could possibly allow the New
York City and New York State governments to allocate more funding to
municipal agencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How many municipal employees in the New York State counties were
actively working, have stopped working, or were on leave at the end of
the fiscal year for 2022?</li>
<li>Which New York State county had the highest mean base salary?</li>
<li>Were there any New York State counties who gave more overtime pay to
their municipal employees than others?</li>
<li>Were there any differences in the median base salary among the
counties?</li>
<li>Which county had the highest median base salary in terms of annual,
daily, hourly, and prorated annual pay basis?</li>
<li>Is there a significant difference in the mean base salary across all
counties?</li>
<li>What percentage of all municipal employees are actively working,
have ceased working, or are on leave at the end of the fiscal year in
2022?</li>
<li>Which counties have a significant difference in the mean base salary
when compared to other counties?</li>
</ol>
<p>During the course of our project, we decided to look at the job title
variable. The new questions that we considered were:</p>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What were the top 10 job titles throughout the New York State
counties and the number of employees for each of those job titles?</li>
<li>What were the top 5 job titles in Kings county, Albany county, New
York county, Richmond county, Bronx county, and Queens county?</li>
<li>What were the top 10 jobs in New York County?</li>
<li>Which job title had the highest frequency in Albany county?</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data that was used for this project is from a NYC Open Data
webpage <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e">link</a>
entitled “Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)”. It was collected with
the purpose of understanding how New York City’s budget is utilized on
salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. However, it is
important to note that the data contains information pertaining to
municipal employees throughout various counties in New York State. This
source of data is updated annually and was last updated on October 28,
2022.</p>
<p>The raw data consisted of 5,109,775 rows and 17 columns, which were
fiscal year, payroll number, the name of the agency, last name of the
employee, first name of the employee, middle initial of the employee,
the date that the employee started working for the agency, the borough
of the employee’s primary work location, the civil service title
description, the leave status of the employee at the end of the fiscal
year on June 30th, the base salary of the employee, pay basis, the
number of regular hours that the employee worked in the fiscal year, the
amount paid to the employee for base salary during the fiscal year,
overtime hours worked by the employee during the fiscal year, the total
overtime pay that was paid to the employee in the fiscal year, and total
other pay. The borough of the employee’s primary work location variable
are counties throughout New York State instead of just being the five
boroughs in New York City. The pay basis is whether the employee was
paid by hour, per diem, or annually. The total other pay variable is any
financial compensation in addition to overtime pay and gross salary,
which would include lump sums, meal allowance, settlement amounts,
differentials, uniform allowance, retroactive pay increases, and bonus
pay. This data does not show salary increases that are received during
any one fiscal year.</p>
<p>The data was read into R as a .csv file using the “read_csv”
function. All of the variable names were then changed to lowercase and
an underscore was used between spaces by using the “clean_names”
function. We then filtered the data to only include records from the
fiscal year of 2022. We also filtered the data to remove records
containing “NA”, “OTHER”, and “WASHINGTON DC” for the
“work_location_borough” variable. In addition, we also filtered the data
to remove records consisting of “ON SEPARATION LEAVE” and “SEASONAL” for
the “leave_status_as_of_june_30” variable, and removed records
containing “NA” for the “title_description” variable. The
“agency_start_date” variable, which is the date that the employee
started at the agency, was separated into three variables, “month”,
“day”, and “start_year”. The variables “leave_status_as_of_june_30” and
“work_location_borough” were duplicated and renamed into “leave_status”
and “county_name”, respectively. The records containing “per Annum”,
“per Day”, and “per Hour” for the pay basis variable were recoded into
“Annually”, “Daily”, and “Hourly”, respectively. The records containing
“MANHATTAN” and “BROOKLYN” for the county name variable were recoded
into “New York” and “Kings”, respectively. The variables of payroll
number, first name of the employee, last name of the employee, middle
initial of the employee, month of the employee’s start date, day of the
employee’s start date, the duplicated “leave_status_as_of_june_30”, the
duplicated “work_location_borough”, the number of regular hours that the
employee worked in the fiscal year, the amount paid to the employee for
base salary during the fiscal year, and the overtime hours worked by the
employee during the fiscal year were then removed from the data. The
variables for county name, pay basis, and leave status were changed from
a character data type to a factor. The variable for “title_description”
was then duplicated and renamed into “job_title”. The duplicated
“title_description” variable was then removed from the data. The data
that was cleaned resulted in 594,234 records and 10 columns.</p>

<p>Exploratory analysis for our primary outcome of whether there is a
significant difference in the mean base salary of employees in New York
State by county in 2022 was conducted by creating a bar graph (Figure
1). Figure 1 shows the average base salary for municipal employees of
New York State by county. This figure illustrates that Albany county has
the highest mean base salary for its municipal employees, while Nassau
county has the lowest average base salary and New York county has the
second lowest mean base salary. All of the other counties have similar
average base salaries. However, we hypothesized that New York county
would have the highest mean salary as it serves as a major financial
center within the United States compared to Albany county, which is the
capital of New York State.</p>

<p>We investigated the number of job titles that are held by municipal
employees in New York State by county in 2022 through a bar graph
(Figure 2). Figure 2 conveys the number of job titles that are held by
employees within each of the 16 counties in New York State. This figure
demonstrates that Orange county has the lowest number of job titles,
while Albany has the third lowest number of job titles. It is important
to note that each of the five boroughs in New York City are among the
counties that have the five highest counts of job titles that are held
by municipal employees in 2022: New York county has the highest, which
was expected; Queens county has the second highest number; Kings county
has the third highest number; Bronx has the fourth highest number;
Richmond has the fifth highest number. We did expect that New York
county would have the highest number of job titles held by municipal
employees and we also expected that the other boroughs of New York City
would also have among the highest counts due to the large size of the
populations within each of these counties within New York City. All of
the other counties within New York State may have low frequencies of job
titles that will be held by municipal workers in 2022, because of their
smaller population sizes.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows the base salary for municipal employees that are paid
annually in New York State by county. According to this figure , Orange
county has the lowest median base salary around 60,000 dollars for its
municipal employees, whereas Albany has the highest median base salary
of about 80,000 dollars followed by New York county. Compared to the
mean base salary, the median base salary in New York was similar to
Albany.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an exploratory analysis was conducted to comprehend the
top ten job titles that are held by municipal workers throughout the
counties in New York State in 2022 through a bar graph (Figure 7). Based
on Figure 7, the top ten job titles by frequency are Correction Officer,
School Aide, Police Officer, Substitute Education Paraprofessional,
General Education Teacher, Special Education Teacher, Education
Paraprofessional, Election Worker, Teacher, and Teacher Per Session,
respectively in ascending order. The top 9 job titles by frequency were
in New York county with Teacher Per Session being the job title with the
highest frequency. The job title with the 10th highest frequency was in
Queens county and was a Correction Officer. We did predict that one of
the teacher job titles would be the job title with the highest
frequency, but we did not expect that it would be the Teacher Per
Session job title. We also expected that all of the top 10 job titles
with the highest frequencies would be in New York County. Overall, this
figure supports some of our predictions and illustrates that the job
title with the highest frequency in Queens is a Correction Officer.</p>

<p>Since we are based in New York City, we decided to look at the top 5
job titles for each of the counties for the 5 boroughs in NYC and
compare them with the top 5 job titles in Albany county because Albany
has the highest mean base salary. We chose Richmond county, Bronx
county, Kings county, Queens county, and New York county as they all
represent boroughs of New York City, which is one of the largest
financial epicenters. These counties were also chosen because they had
the highest number of job titles. We conducted a scatterplot to see the
top 5 job titles within each of the aforementioned counties. Looking at
the plot, one can observe that in New York county, the number of
Teachers per Session was 113,882 meaning that New York County has the
highest number of teachers per session among the six counties. Queens
county had the highest number of correction officers, 7,708. For Bronx
county, their highest job title was a Police Officer, 3,807. However,
Kings county had the most Police Officers as they had 5,815. Albany
county had the most number of Assistant Legislative Representatives,
which was 4.</p>

<p>An exploratory analysis was performed to understand the median total
other pay for municipal employees throughout New York State by county in
2022 through a boxplot (Figure 12). Figure 12 demonstrates that New York
county has the lowest median for total other pay, which is relatively
close to 0 dollars, while Schoharie county has the highest median for
total other pay, which is relatively above 5000 dollars for municipal
workers. We did not expect New York county to have the lowest median for
total other pay, but instead be one of the counties with the highest
median for total other pay due to the large population and number of job
titles within this county (Figure 2). All of the other counties have
relatively similar medians for total other pay in 2022. It is also
important to note that New York county has the greatest number of
outliers, which may be due to the large population within this county.
Based on figure 12, Queens, Bronx, and Kings counties also have high
numbers of outliers, which may also be due to the large populations
within these counties. There are counties that do not have any outliers,
such as Sullivan, Delaware, Greene, and Orange counties. This figure
also illustrates that there are employees in some of the counties that
have negative values for other types of pay, which can include lump
sums, meal allowance, settlement amounts, differentials, uniform
allowance, retroactive pay increases, and bonus pay. These other forms
of payment would explain why there are negative values for this
variable.</p>

We also wanted to look at the leave status to know how many municipal

We constructed a pie chart which shows the percentages of leave status
for all municipal employees in New York State in 2022. We assumed that
the majority of the municipal employees across all New York state
counties would have a leave status that was active. 81.1% of the
municipal employees were actively working, which was to be expected.
17.2 % of employees have stopped working at their municipal jobs and
1.7% of municipal employees were on leave.</p>

<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p>For additional analysis, an ANOVA was done to determine whether there
is a significant difference in mean base salary for municipal workers
between the counties in New York State in 2022. The null hypothesis is
that all the base salary means for each county are equal. The
alternative hypothesis is that not all the base salary means for each
county are equal. The significance level for this test is 0.05. The
p-value for this test is 0 (Table 1). Since the p-value = 0 &lt; 0.05,
we reject the null hypothesis that all the base salary means for each
county are equal. There is sufficient evidence in this data to support
the claim that not all of the base salary means for each county are
equal at the 5 % significance level.</p>
<p>Since the ANOVA test does not indicate which base salary means are
different and we need to control and preserve the overall family-wise
error rate at the pre-specified alpha level of 0.05, we conducted a
Tukey’s test. Based on Table 2, the following county comparisons have
significant differences in mean salary for municipal workers in 2022 as

<h2>Discussions</h2>
<p>In our exploratory analysis, we looked at leave status, base salary,
overtime pay, job titles, total other pay, and base salary by pay basis
across New York State counties in 2022. Before calculating the
percentages and numbers of leave-status employees for all 16 counties,
we predicted that most municipal employees had an active leave status.
This prediction was correct as most of the 594,234 employees were
actively working. The majority of the remaining number of employees were
ceased and very few were on leave.</p>
<p>When looking at the mean salary of municipal employees in New York
State counties, we found it interesting that Albany had the highest mean
base salary. We identified a notable difference in the average base
salary between the counties of New York and Albany. It was interesting
that the average base salary in New York county was low compared to the
majority of the New York State counties because it is known as a
financial hub in the United States.</p>
<p>Since Albany had the highest mean base salary, we decided to look at
the job titles across all 16 counties in New York. We also expected New
York county to have the most job titles due to its large population.
When looking at the number of job titles in New York State counties, New
York county, Queens county, Kings county, Bronx county, had the top four
highest number of job titles, respectively. We found it interesting that
Albany county had the third lowest number of job titles meaning that the
variability of jobs is low.</p>
<p>We also looked at the top 5 job titles in Bronx, Kings, Queens, New
York, and Albany counties. The most prominent job titles were Correction
Officer, Assistant Legislative Representative, and Teachers per Session.
It was interesting that Albany had the fewest job titles, 6, even though
Albany had the highest mean base salary. Overall, this information
illustrates that certain job titles that pay higher base salaries can
skew the data even though there are very few people with these job
titles.</p>
<p>We also looked at the median total other pay for municipal employees
across all of the New York State counties in 2022. We found out that New
York county had the lowest median total other pay, while Schoharie
county had the highest with approximately more than five thousand
dollars for municipal employees. We did not expect this result and
believed New York county would have the highest median for the total
other pay. It is essential to acknowledge that New York county had
numerous outliers, which could have been possibly due to its large
population. Other counties that had many outliers were Queens, Bronx,
and Kings.</p>
<p>In addition to looking at the mean base salary, we also looked at the
median base salary for employees that are paid annually, daily, hourly,
and prorated annually. Albany had the highest median base salary for
those that were paid annually followed by New York county. As for those
that were paid daily, Albany, Dutchess, and Greene counties had the
highest median base salary. Nassau county had the highest hourly median
base salary. Ulster county had the highest median base salary for those
that prorated annually, followed by New York county.</p>
<p>We also investigated which county had the highest median overtime pay
for municipal employees in New York State. New York county had the
lowest median total overtime pay while Greene county had the highest. We
found this interesting because Greene county’s small population may
result in higher overtime pay while the large population in New York
county may result in the opposite as more people would want to engage in
overtime opportunities.</p>
<p>In our statistical analysis, specifically the ANOVA test, we
hypothesized that there is a significant difference between the means of
base salary for the New York State counties. This hypothesis was proven
to be true as the p value was zero, which supported the rejection of the
null hypothesis that there was no difference in the mean base salary
among the counties. We also predicted that there would be significant
differences in the mean base salary between the counties. With the Tukey
test, we saw that there were many significant differences in the mean
base salary when comparing the counties among one another. Some
significant differences were: New York and Albany, Kings and Bronx, New
York and Bronx, Richmond and Kings, and Queens and Bronx. Ultimately, we
saw that most of the significant differences were between NYC’s 5
boroughs and Albany as their p values were less than 0.05.</p>
