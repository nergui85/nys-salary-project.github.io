<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>New York City (NYC) is recognized as having the largest city and
regional economies in the United States (Wikipedia, 2022). If New York
City were an individual country, it would be ranked as the 10th largest
global economy (Wikipedia, 2022). Our motivation for this project is to
use the skills that we have learned in Data Science I and apply them to
answer imperative questions about NYC, such as which NYC borough yields
the highest and lowest average total pay, which would combine salary,
overtime, and other pay, in 2022 from data related to New York City’s
budget on the salaries and overtime pay of municipal employees.</p>
<p>Cities around the country suffered greatly from the worst pandemic
hit and the prospects of a recession began stirring fears of what the
next couple of years will hold.Cities are more cautious about spending
its budget compared to the previous years in response to COVID -19. As a
result, many states and municipalities have made cuts, frozen spending
and hiring, laid off workers and cut down the funds. Our project is to
provide a visualization on how the City’s budget is being spent on
salary and for the interest of the public as well as for those recent
graduates looking for opportunities in City jobs, New York by conducting
statistical analysis to evaluate the significant differences in base
salary counties.</p>

<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>In 2022, the economy is trying to get back to normalcy, however, the
challenge is continuing to be present in various sectors. According to
Omeyr, “Governments are being super cautious and very conservative when
it comes to budgeting for the near future and for fiscal year 2022 and
2023. The New York State Budget will total $220.5 billion in 2022-23.
The Budget was adopted following two years of extraordinary volatility
in State finances that began with the unprecedented economic disruptions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the prospect of steep revenue
shortfalls. Due to Economic performance suppression, unanticipated
revenues were generated and spending as increased greatly, both for
temporary investments for pandemic-related needs and expanded or new
commitments to existing programs. Allocating a budget on the payroll is
one of the state’s duties. The data is from the NYC Open data and it was
collected because NYC residents were interested in how the City’s budget
is being allocated on salary and overtime pay for municipal employees.
This dataset is by the Office of Payroll Administration(OPA).<br />
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median wage for
workers in the United States in the second quarter of 2022 was about
1,041 per week of 54,132 per year (assuming 52 weeks of work per year).
Wages were 5.2% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p>Number reports on statistics have stated that the employment
increased in all five New York City boroughs from March 2021 to March
2022, the U.S. The Bureau of Labour Statistics reported. Although most
New York residents earned incomes at least 400 percent of the federal
poverty level (FPL), its median annual household income between 2011 and
2013 was lowest among its neighboring states, $51,962. The state had the
highest proportion of residents who earned incomes below 100 percent of
the FPL. Apparently this pattern has persisted throughout the years. It
has proven in our data that the average base salary for municipal
employees of New York county was among one of the lowest.</p>

<h2>Data Processing and Cleaning</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>The data that was used for this project is from a NYC Open Data
webpage (hyperlink this) entitled “Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)”.
It was collected with the purpose of understanding how New York City’s
budget is utilized on salary and overtime pay for all municipal
employees. However, it is important to note that the data contains
information pertaining to municipal employees throughout various
counties in New York State. This source of data is updated annually and
was last updated on October 28, 2022. The raw data consisted of
5,109,775 rows and 17 columns, which were fiscal year, payroll number,
the name of the agency, last name of the employee, first name of the
employee, middle initial of the employee, the date that the employee
started working for the agency, the borough of the employee’s primary
work location, the civil service title description, the leave status of
the employee at the end of the fiscal year on June 30th, the base salary
of the employee, pay basis, the number of regular hours that the
employee worked in the fiscal year, the amount paid to the employee for
base salary during the fiscal year, overtime hours worked by the
employee during the fiscal year, the total overtime pay that was paid to
the employee in the fiscal year, and total other pay. The borough of the
employee’s primary work location variable are counties throughout New
York State instead of just being the five boroughs in New York City. The
pay basis is whether is the employee was paid by hour, per diem, or
annually. The total other pay variable is any financial compensation in
addition to overtime pay and gross salary, which would include lump
sums, meal allowance, settlement amounts, differentials, uniform
allowance, retroactive pay increases, and bonus pay. This data does not
show salary increases that are received during any one fiscal
year.</p></li>
<li><p>The data was read into R as a .csv file using the “read_csv”
function. All of the variable names were then changed to lowercase and
an underscore was used between spaces by using the “clean_names”
function. We then filtered the data to only include records from the
fiscal year of 2022. We also filtered the data to remove records
containing “NA”, “OTHER”, and “WASHINGTON DC” for the
“work_location_borough” variable. In addition, we also filtered the data
to remove records consisting of “ON SEPARATION LEAVE” and “SEASONAL” for
the “leave_status_as_of_june_30” variable, and removed records
containing “NA” for the “title_description” variable. The
“agency_start_date” variable, which is the date that the employee
started at the agency, was separated into three variables, “month”,
“day”, and “start_year”. The variables “leave_status_as_of_june_30”,
“work_location_borough”, and “title_description” were duplicated and
renamed into “leave_status”, “county_name”, and “job_title”,
respectively. The records containing “per Annum”, “per Day”, and “per
Hour” for the pay basis variable were recoded into “Annually”, “Daily”,
and “Hourly”, respectively. The records containing “MANHATTAN” and
“BROOKLYN” for the county name variable were recoded into “New York” and
“Kings”, respectively. The variables of payroll number, first name of
the employee, last name of the employee, middle initial of the employee,
month of the employee’s start date, day of the employee’s start date,
the duplicated “leave_status_as_of_june_30”, the duplicated
“work_location_borough”, the number of regular hours that the employee
worked in the fiscal year, the amount paid to the employee for base
salary during the fiscal year, and the overtime hours worked by the
employee during the fiscal year were then removed from the data. The
variables for county name, pay basis, and leave status were changed from
a character data type to a factor. The variable for “title_description”
was then duplicated and renamed into “job_title”. The duplicated
“title_description” variable was then removed from the data. The data
that was cleaned resulted in 594,234 records and 10 columns.</p></li>

base salary for its municipal employees, while Nassau county has the
lowest average base salary and New York county has the second lowest
mean base salary. All of the other counties have similar average base
salaries. However, we hypothesized that New York county would have the
highest mean salary as it serves as a major financial center within the

<p>Figure (2) demonstrates that New York county has the lowest median
for total other pay, which is relatively close to 0 dollars, while
Schoharie county has the highest median for total other pay, which is
relatively above 5000 dollars for municipal workers. We did not expect
New York county to have the lowest median for total other pay, but
instead be one of the counties with the highest median for total other
pay due to the large population and number of job titles within this
county. All of the other counties have relatively similar medians for
total other pay in 2022. It is also important to note that New York
county has the greatest number of outliers, which may be due to the
large population within this county. Based on our previous finding,
Queens, Bronx, and Kings counties also have high numbers of outliers,
which may also be due to the large populations within these counties.
There are counties that do not have any outliers, such as Sullivan,
Delaware, Greene, and Orange counties. This figure also illustrates that
there are employees in some of the counties that have negative values
for other types of pay, which can include lump sums, meal allowance,
settlement amounts, differentials, uniform allowance, retroactive pay
increases, and bonus pay. These other forms of payment would explain why
there are negative values for this variable.</p>

<p>Figure (3) illustrated that New York county was among the lowest
median counties for total overtime along with Albany, Nassau, New York
and Orange which was close to 0 dollars, while Greene ranked highest
median for total overtime pay with around 7000 dollars. This pattern is
similar to that of New York County for median for total other pay where
it placed the lowest. (graphic). We assumed that since New York County
has a big market with more opportunities and its hard working lifestyle
will allow employees to benefit more from overtime pay. This finding
contracted with our hypothesis and median for prorated annual base
salary (figure 4) where New York County ranked highest. In addition, it
was noticeable that New York county has the greatest number of outliers,
which may be due to the large population within this county whereas
Greene, Orange and Dutchess counties did have outliers.</p>

<p>Figure(7) displays prorated median base salary for municipal
employees of New York State by county. A prorated salary is when an
employee gets paid based on the number of hours or days they work in a
pay period, instead of their regular salary. When compared to annual
median base salary, prorated median base salary was highest for Ulster
followed by New York Country where Bronx and Richmond ranked the lowest.
This indicates that employees in Ulster and New York Counties work
longer hours and with extra days. This finding is in line with our
hypothesis that the Median Base Salary for New York County was higher
according to its prorated values.</p>

<p>Figure (8) conveys the number of job titles that are held by
employees within each of the 16 counties in New York State. This figure
demonstrates that Orange county has the lowest number of job titles,
while Albany has the third lowest number of job titles. It is important
to note that each of the five boroughs in New York City are among the
counties that have the five highest counts of job titles that are held
by municipal employees in 2022: New York county has the highest, which
was expected; Queens county has the second highest number; Kings county
has the third highest number; Bronx has the fourth highest number;
Richmond has the fifth highest number. We did expect that New York
county would have the highest number of job titles held by municipal
employees and we also expected that the other boroughs of New York City
would also have among the highest counts due to the large size of the
populations within each of these counties within New York City. All of
the other counties within New York State may have low frequencies of job
titles that are held by municipal workers in 2022, because of their
smaller population sizes.</p>

Correction Officer, School Aide, Police Officer, Substitute Education
Paraprofessional, General Education Teacher, Special Education Teacher,
Education Paraprofessional, Election Worker, Teacher, and Teacher Per
Session, respectively in ascending order. The top 9 job titles by
frequency were in New York county with Teacher Per Session being the job
title with the highest frequency. The job title with the 10th highest
frequency was in Queens county and was a Correction Officer. We did
predict that one of the teacher job titles would be the job title with
the highest frequency, but we did not expect that it would be the
Teacher Per Session job title. We also expected that all of the top 10
job titles with the highest frequencies would be in New York County.
Overall, this figure supports some of our predictions and illustrates
that the job title with the highest frequency in Queens is a Correction
Officer.</p>

<p>We assumed that the top ten job titles would explain this finding.
Based on Figure 6,7 , the top ten job titles in New York County are
community associate, school aide, police officer, substitute education,
election worker, teacher and Teacher Per Session. However, there were
only 6 top titles in Albany, which are supervisor, assistant director,
special assistant, watershed maintainer, assistant legislative
representative. As we expected these top job titles explained our main
finding on mean salary that top 6 job titles were higher rank jobs as
compared to New York County.</p>
