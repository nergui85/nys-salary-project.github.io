<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>New York City (NYC) is recognized as having the largest regional
economy in the United States (5).If an individual country, it would be
ranked as the 10th largest global economy (6). Our motivation for this
project is to use the skills that we have learned in Data Science I and
apply them to answer imperative questions about NYC, such as which NYC
borough yields the highest and lowest average total pay. This data would
be determined by combining salary, overtime, and other pay from NYC’s
2022 municipal employees ’payroll budget.</p>
<p>Cities around the country suffered economic losses from the COVID-19
pandemic and the prospects of a recession began stirring fears of an
uncertain economy. City managers are more cautious about fiscal spending
compared to previous years in response to COVID -19. As a result, many
states and municipalities have made cuts, frozen spending and hiring,
laid off workers and have reduced budgets. Our project will detail how
the City’s budget is being spent on by conducting statistical analysis
to evaluate the significant differences in base salary among New York
State. This information should prove useful to the general public as
well as for recent graduates looking for opportunities in NYC municipal
employment.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related work</h2>
<p>As the economy recovers in 2022, challenges are found in various
sectors. (1). According to Omeyr, “Governments are being super cautious
and very conservative when it comes to budgeting for the near future and
for fiscal year 2022 and 2023”. The New York State Budget will total
$220.5 billion in 2022-23. The Budget was adopted following two years of
extraordinary volatility in State finances that began with the
unprecedented economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and
the prospect of steep revenue shortfalls. Due to Economic performance
suppression, unanticipated revenues were generated and spending as
increased greatly, both for temporary investments for pandemic-related
needs and expanded or new commitments to existing programs (3).
Allocating a budget on the payroll is one of the state’s duties. This
data was obtained from the NYC Open data records. This dataset is
provided by the Office of Payroll Administration (OPA).<br />
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median wage for
workers in the United States in the second quarter of 2022 was about
$1,041 per week or $54,132 per year (assuming 52 weeks of work per
year). Wages were 5.2% higher than a year earlier (5). BLS statistics
show that employment increased in all five New York City boroughs from
March 2021 to March 2022 (2). Although most New York State residents
earned incomes at least 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL),
its median annual household income between 2011 and 2013 was lowest
among its neighboring states, $51,962. The state had the highest
proportion of residents who earned incomes below the FPL(4). Apparently
this pattern has persisted throughout the years. It has proven in our
data that the average base salary for municipal employees of New York
county was among one of the lowest.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How many municipal employees in the New York State counties were
active, have stopped working, or were on leave?</li>
<li>Which New York State counties had the highest mean base salary?</li>
<li>Were there any New York State counties who gave more overtime pay to
their municipal employees than others?</li>
<li>Were there any differences in the median base salary among the
counties?</li>
<li>Which county had the highest median base salary in terms of annual,
daily, hourly, and prorated annual pay basis?</li>
<li>Is there a significant difference in the mean base salary across all
counties?</li>
<li>What percentage of all municipal employees are active, have ceased
working, or are on leave?</li>
<li>Which counties have a significant difference in the mean base salary
when compared to other counties?</li>
</ol>
<p>During the course of our project, we decided to look at the job title
variable. The new questions that we considered were:</p>
<ol start="9" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What were the top 10 job titles throughout the New York State
counties?</li>
<li>What were the top 5 job titles in Kings county, Albany county, New
York county, Richmond county, and Queens county?</li>
<li>What were the top 10 jobs in New York County?</li>
<li>Which job title had the highest frequency in Albany county?</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data that was used for this project is from a NYC Open Data
webpage <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e">link</a>
entitled “Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)”. It was collected with
the purpose of understanding how New York City’s budget is utilized on
salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. However, it is
important to note that the data contains information pertaining to
municipal employees throughout various counties in New York State. This
source of data is updated annually and was last updated on October 28,
2022.</p>
<p>The raw data consisted of 5,109,775 rows and 17 columns, which were
fiscal year, payroll number, the name of the agency, last name of the
employee, first name of the employee, middle initial of the employee,
the date that the employee started working for the agency, the borough
of the employee’s primary work location, the civil service title
description, the leave status of the employee at the end of the fiscal
year on June 30th, the base salary of the employee, pay basis, the
number of regular hours that the employee worked in the fiscal year, the
amount paid to the employee for base salary during the fiscal year,
overtime hours worked by the employee during the fiscal year, the total
overtime pay that was paid to the employee in the fiscal year, and total
other pay. The borough of the employee’s primary work location variable
are counties throughout New York State instead of just being the five
boroughs in New York City. The pay basis is whether the employee was
paid by hour, per diem, or annually. The total other pay variable is any
financial compensation in addition to overtime pay and gross salary,
which would include lump sums, meal allowance, settlement amounts,
differentials, uniform allowance, retroactive pay increases, and bonus
pay. This data does not show salary increases that are received during
any one fiscal year.</p>
<p>The data was read into R as a .csv file using the “read_csv”
function. All of the variable names were then changed to lowercase and
an underscore was used between spaces by using the “clean_names”
function. We then filtered the data to only include records from the
fiscal year of 2022. We also filtered the data to remove records
containing “NA”, “OTHER”, and “WASHINGTON DC” for the
“work_location_borough” variable. In addition, we also filtered the data
to remove records consisting of “ON SEPARATION LEAVE” and “SEASONAL” for
the “leave_status_as_of_june_30” variable, and removed records
containing “NA” for the “title_description” variable. The
“agency_start_date” variable, which is the date that the employee
started at the agency, was separated into three variables, “month”,
“day”, and “start_year”. The variables “leave_status_as_of_june_30” and
“work_location_borough” were duplicated and renamed into “leave_status”
and “county_name”, respectively. The records containing “per Annum”,
“per Day”, and “per Hour” for the pay basis variable were recoded into
“Annually”, “Daily”, and “Hourly”, respectively. The records containing
“MANHATTAN” and “BROOKLYN” for the county name variable were recoded
into “New York” and “Kings”, respectively. The variables of payroll
number, first name of the employee, last name of the employee, middle
initial of the employee, month of the employee’s start date, day of the
employee’s start date, the duplicated “leave_status_as_of_june_30”, the
duplicated “work_location_borough”, the number of regular hours that the
employee worked in the fiscal year, the amount paid to the employee for
base salary during the fiscal year, and the overtime hours worked by the
employee during the fiscal year were then removed from the data. The
variables for county name, pay basis, and leave status were changed from
a character data type to a factor. The variable for “title_description”
was then duplicated and renamed into “job_title”. The duplicated
“title_description” variable was then removed from the data. The data
that was cleaned resulted in 594,234 records and 10 columns.</p>

<p>Exploratory analysis for our primary outcome of whether there is a
significant difference in the mean base salary of employees in New York
State by county in 2022 was conducted by creating a bar graph (Figure
1). Figure 1 shows the average base salary for municipal employees of
New York State by county. This figure illustrates that Albany county has
the highest mean base salary for its municipal employees, while Nassau
county has the lowest average base salary and New York county has the
second lowest mean base salary. All of the other counties have similar
average base salaries. However, we hypothesized that New York county
would have the highest mean salary as it serves as a major financial
center within the United States compared to Albany county, which is the
capital of New York State.</p>

<p>We investigated the number of job titles that are held by municipal
employees in New York State by county in 2022 through a bar graph
(Figure 2). Figure 2 conveys the number of job titles that are held by
employees within each of the 16 counties in New York State. This figure
demonstrates that Orange county has the lowest number of job titles,
while Albany has the third lowest number of job titles. It is important
to note that each of the five boroughs in New York City are among the
counties that have the five highest counts of job titles that are held
by municipal employees in 2022: New York county has the highest, which
was expected; Queens county has the second highest number; Kings county
has the third highest number; Bronx has the fourth highest number;
Richmond has the fifth highest number. We did expect that New York
county would have the highest number of job titles held by municipal
employees and we also expected that the other boroughs of New York City
would also have among the highest counts due to the large size of the
populations within each of these counties within New York City. All of
the other counties within New York State may have low frequencies of job
titles that will be held by municipal workers in 2022, because of their
smaller population sizes.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows the base salary for municipal employees that are paid
annually in New York State by county. According to this Figure 3,
Orange, Greene, Putnam and Bronx have the lowest median base salary
around 60,000 dollars for its municipal employees, whereas Albany has
the highest median base salary with around 85,000 dollars followed by
New York county. Compared to the mean base salary, median base salary in
New York States was significantly higher after Albany, which was similar
to our hypothesis that New York County would have a higher income
level.</p>

of New York State by county. The daily median salary ranged between 50
to 65 dollars. Figure illustrates that Bronx, Delaware, Queens and
Ulster have the lowest daily median base salary which was around 350
dollars while Albany, Dutchess and Greene ranked highest with 500
dollars. The rest of the counties placed in between above values. Daily
median base salary for New York County has many outliers indicating that
median values are not suitable to compute since the range of the daily
base salary varied greatly.</p>

<p>Figure 6 displays prorated median base salary for municipal employees
of New York State by county. A prorated salary is when an employee gets
paid based on the number of hours or days they work in a pay period,
instead of their regular salary. When compared to annual median base
salary, prorated median base salary was highest for Ulster followed by
New York Country where Bronx and Richmond ranked the lowest. This
indicates that employees in Ulster and New York Counties work longer
hours and with extra days. This finding is in line with our hypothesis
that the Median Base Salary for New York County was higher according to
its prorated values.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an exploratory analysis was conducted to comprehend the
top ten job titles that are held by municipal workers throughout the
counties in New York State in 2022 through a bar graph (Figure 7). Based
on Figure 7, the top ten job titles by frequency are Correction Officer,
School Aide, Police Officer, Substitute Education Paraprofessional,
General Education Teacher, Special Education Teacher, Education
Paraprofessional, Election Worker, Teacher, and Teacher Per Session,
respectively in ascending order. The top 9 job titles by frequency were
in New York county with Teacher Per Session being the job title with the
highest frequency. The job title with the 10th highest frequency was in
Queens county and was a Correction Officer. We did predict that one of
the teacher job titles would be the job title with the highest
frequency, but we did not expect that it would be the Teacher Per
Session job title. We also expected that all of the top 10 job titles
with the highest frequencies would be in New York County. Overall, this
figure supports some of our predictions and illustrates that the job
title with the highest frequency in Queens is a Correction Officer.</p>

<p>Since we are based in New York City, NYC, we decided to look at the
top 5 job titles for each of the counties for the 5 boroughs in NYC and
compare that with top 5 job titles with the top 5 job titles in Albany
county because Albany has the highest mean base salary. We chose
Richmond county, Bronx county, Kings county, Queens county, and New York
county as they all represent New York City boroughs which is one of the
largest financial epicenters. These counties were also chosen because
when looking at the bar graph for the number of job titles held by
employees, you saw that the ones that had the most number of job titles
were the counties that were selected. We conducted a scatterplot to see
which county has a high number of specific job titles. Looking at the
plot, you can see that in New York county, the number of teachers per
session was 113,882 meaning that New York County has the highest number
of teachers per session among the six counties. Queens county had the
highest number of correction officers, 7,708. For Bronx county, their
highest job title was a police officer, 3,807. However, it was Kings
county who had the most police officers as they had 5,815. Albany county
had the most number of assistant legislative representatives which was
4.</p>

finding. Based on figures 9 and 10, the top ten job titles in New York
County are community associate, school aide, police officer, substitute
education, election worker, teacher and Teacher Per Session. However,
there were only 6 top titles in Albany, which are supervisor, assistant
director, special assistant, watershed maintainer, assistant legislative

by its counties in 2022 is displayed in the box plot. Figure 11
illustrated that New York county was among the lowest median counties
for total overtime along with Albany, Nassau, New York and Orange which
was close to 0 dollars, while Greene ranked highest median for total
overtime pay with around 7000 dollars. This pattern is similar to that
of New York County for median for total other pay where it placed the
lowest in Figure. We assumed that since New York County has a big market
with more opportunities. This finding supported our hypothesis and
median for prorated annual base salary Figure where New York County
ranked highest. In addition, it was noticeable that New York county has
the greatest number of outliers, which may be due to the large
population within this county whereas Greene, Orange and Dutchess
counties did have outliers.</p>

<p>An exploratory analysis was performed to understand the median total
other pay for municipal employees throughout New York State by county in
2022 through a boxplot (Figure 12). Figure 12 demonstrates that New York
county has the lowest median for total other pay, which is relatively
close to 0 dollars, while Schoharie county has the highest median for
total other pay, which is relatively above 5000 dollars for municipal
workers. We did not expect New York county to have the lowest median for
total other pay, but instead be one of the counties with the highest
median for total other pay due to the large population and number of job
titles within this county (Figure 2). All of the other counties have
relatively similar medians for total other pay in 2022. It is also
important to note that New York county has the greatest number of
outliers, which may be due to the large population within this county.
Based on figure 7, Queens, Bronx, and Kings counties also have high
numbers of outliers, which may also be due to the large populations
within these counties. There are counties that do not have any outliers,
such as Sullivan, Delaware, Greene, and Orange counties. This figure
also illustrates that there are employees in some of the counties that
have negative values for other types of pay, which can include lump
sums, meal allowance, settlement amounts, differentials, uniform
allowance, retroactive pay increases, and bonus pay. These other forms
of payment would explain why there are negative values for this
variable.</p>

<p>We also performed a bar graph to show the distribution of leave
status. In 2022, there were a total of 594,234 municipal employees
across New York state counties. The graph shows that 481,781 municipal
employees had a leave status of active and 102,360 employees had a leave
status of ceased. The remaining number of municipal employees, 10,093,
were on leave.</p>

<p>We constructed a pie chart which shows the percentages of leave
status for all municipal employees in 2022. We assumed that the majority
of the municipal employees across all New York state counties would have
a leave status of active. 81.1 % of the municipal employees were
actively working which was to be expected. 17.2 % of employees have
stopped working at their municipal jobs and 1.7 municipal employees were
on leave.</p>

<h2>Additional Analysis</h2>
<p>For additional analysis, an ANOVA was done to determine whether there
is a significant difference in mean base salary for municipal workers
between the counties in New York State in 2022. The null hypothesis is
that all the base salary means for each county are equal. The
alternative hypothesis is that not all the base salary means for each
county are equal. The significance level for this test is 0.05. The
p-value for this test is 0 (Table 1). Since the p-value = 0 &lt; 0.05,
we reject the null hypothesis that all the base salary means for each
county are equal. There is sufficient evidence in this data to support
the claim that not all of the base salary means for each county are
equal at the 5 % significance level.</p>
<p>Since the ANOVA test does not indicate which base salary means are
different and we need to control and preserve the overall family-wise
error rate at the pre-specified alpha level of 0.05, we conducted a
Tukey’s test. Based on Table 2, the following county comparisons have
significant differences in mean salary for municipal workers in 2022 as
the p-values are less than 0.05 and the null value of 0 is not included
within the corresponding confidence interval: Bronx and Albany, Nassau
and Albany, New York and Albany, Richmond and Albany, Kings and Bronx,
New York and Bronx, Queens and Bronx, Richmond and Bronx, Sullivan and
Bronx, Ulster and Bronx, Westchester and Bronx, Nassau and Delaware, New
York and Delaware, Nassau and Kings, New York and Kings, Richmond and
Kings, Ulster and Kings, Westchester and Kings, Queens and Nassau,
Richmond and Nassau, Sullivan and Nassau, Ulster and Nassau, Westchester
and Nassau, Queens and New York, Richmond and New York, Sullivan and New
York, Ulster and New York, Westchester and New York, Ulster and Queens,
Westchester and Queens, Ulster and Richmond, and Westchester and
Richmond.</p>

<h2>Discussions</h2>
<p>In our exploratory analysis, we looked at leave status, base salary,
overtime pay, job titles, total other pay, and base salary by pay basis
across New York State counties in 2022.</p>
<p>Prior to computing the percentages and numbers of leave status
employees for all 16 counties, we predicted that most of the municipal
employees had an active leave status at the end of the fiscal year,
which was true as the majority of the 594,234 employees were actively
working. The remaining number of employees were either on leave or
stopped working.</p>
<p>When looking at the mean salary of municipal employees in New State
York counties, we found it interesting that Albany had the highest mean
base salary. We saw that there was a notable difference in the average
base salary between New York County and Albany county. We assumed that
the average base salary in New York county would be fairly high due to
it being known as a financial hub in New York State and throughout the
United States.</p>
<p>Since Albany had the highest mean base salary, we decided to look at
the job titles across all 16 counties in New York. We also expected that
New York county would have the most number of job titles due its large
population. When looking at the number of job titles in New York state
counties, New York county did indeed have the highest number of job
titles. Queens county had the second highest number, Kings county had
the third highest number, and Bronx county had the fourth highest number
of job titles. We found it interesting that Albany county had the third
lowest number of job titles meaning that the variability of jobs is
low.</p>
<p>We also looked at the top 5 job titles across Bronx, Kings, Queens,
New York, Richmond, and Albany counties. The most prominent job titles
were Correction Officer, Assistant Legislative Representative, Teacher
per session, and Police Officer. It was interesting that Albany had the
fewest number of job titles, which was 6, and the highest mean base
salary. The job title with the highest number of people in Albany county
is the Assistant Legislative Representative. Four people had this job
title. The other job titles for Albany were Watershed Maintainer,
Assistant Director of Intergovernmental Relations for Albany, Special
Assistant, Stationary Engineer and Supervisor. Overall, this information
illustrates that certain job titles that pay higher base salaries can
skew the data even though there are very few people with these job
titles.</p>
<p>We also looked at the total other pay for municipal employees across
all New York State counties in 2022 and found that New York county had
the lowest median total other pay, while Schoharie county had the
highest, which was approximately more than 5,000 dollars for municipal
employees. This was a result that we did not expect and we believed that
New York county would also have the highest median total other pay. It
is important to acknowledge that New York county had numerous outliers
which could have been possible due to its large population and the large
diversity of job titles. Other counties that had many outliers were
Queens, Bronx, and Kings.</p>
<p>In addition to looking at the mean base salary, we also chose to look
at the median base salary by annual, daily, hourly, and prorated annual
pay basis. Albany had the highest annual median base salary with New
York county coming in second. For the daily median base salary, Albany,
Dutchess, and Greene county had among the highest. Nassau county had the
highest hourly median base salary. For the median prorated annual base
salary, Ulster county had the highest followed by New York county.</p>
<p>We also determined which county had the highest median total overtime
pay for municipal employees in New York State counties in 2022. It was
found that New York had the lowest median total overtime pay while
Greene county had the highest.</p>
<p>In our statistical analysis, specifically the ANOVA test, we claimed
that there is a significant difference between the means of base salary
for the New York State counties. This hypothesis was proven to be true
as the p value was zero, which supported the rejection of the null
hypothesis that there was no difference in the mean base salary among
the counties. We also predicted that there would be significant
differences in the mean base salary between the counties. With the Tukey
test, we saw that there were many significant differences in the mean
base salary when comparing the counties among one another. Some
significant differences were: New York and Albany, Kings and Bronx, New
York and Bronx, Richmond and Kings, and Ulster and Kings. Ultimately, we
saw that most of the significant differences were between NYC’s 5
boroughs and Albany as their p values were less than 0.05.</p>
